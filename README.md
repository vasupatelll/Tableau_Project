I am a Tableau loving data analyst who has built an end-to-end project on global COVID-19 spread. Leveraging multiple data sources, I built interactive dashboards and visualizations to monitor the growth of this pandemic.

The Project reflects the number of people fully, partially and unvaccinated.

The dashboards allow users to interact with the data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner which makes understanding a little bit more bearable for such as complex environment that is changing rapidly. This project was an opportunity for me to extract and display insightful information from complex data, emphasizing the value of using such insights in decision making.
